Port4lio

## Client
BSCoE 2-4 - The selected client base for our website, Port4lio, primarily consists of Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering (BSCpE) students in their second to fourth years of study (BSCpE 2-4). Port4lio is meticulously crafted to cater specifically to the unique needs and aspirations of these students, providing a tailored platform for showcasing their academic accomplishments, projects, and experiences as they progress through their computer engineering education and professional development journey.

## Project Description
It is a dedicated website designed to meet the specific needs of Computer Engineering (CpE) students in their 2nd year OJT - especifically for section 2-4. Tailored to cater to the requirements of portfolio development for their on-the-job training (OJT) endeavors, this platform aims to provide a comprehensive and user-friendly space for CpE students to showcase their academic achievements, projects, and practical experiences. The website will feature customizable templates and tools that allow students to create professional portfolios, highlighting their skills, accomplishments, and contributions during their OJT. Additionally, the platform will offer guidance on structuring OJT documents, incorporating industry best practices, and preparing for professional milestones. With a focus on ease of use and relevance to CpE students' career goals, the CpE Student Port4lio strives to empower individuals in their academic and professional journey by providing a centralized resource for portfolio development and OJT documentation.
